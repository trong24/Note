====== ansible ======
Created Tuesday 27 February 2018

ansible multi -s -m yum -a "name=ntp state=present"
The -s option (alias for --sudo )
pass in -K (alias for --ask-sudo-pass )

The ansible-playbook command also allows for some other common options:
* --inventory=PATH ( -i PATH ): Define a custom inventory file (default is the default Ansible
inventory file, usually located at /etc/ansible/hosts ).
* --verbose ( -v ): Verbose mode (show all output, including output from successful options).
You can pass in -vvvv to give every minute detail.
* --extra-vars=VARS ( -e VARS ): Define variables to be used in the playbook, in "key=value,key=value"
format.
* --forks=NUM ( -f NUM ): Number for forks (integer). Set this to a number higher than 5 to
increase the number of servers on which Ansible will run tasks concurrently.
* --connection=TYPE ( -c TYPE ): The type of connection which will be used (this defaults to
ssh ; you might sometimes want to use local to run a playbook on your local machine, or on
a remote server via cron).
* --check : Run the playbook in Check Mode (‘Dry Run’); all tasks defined in the playbook will
be checked against all hosts, but none will actually be run.
